Test Plan For Assignment 3:

1) User input can be any case-insensitive versions of the full words
   of the options or the upper and lower case versions of the first letters
   of the option names.

2) The program will repeatly ask for proper input if user fails to provide 
   it. For example, if user enters just a quantity, and not a price, it will
   prompt for for both.

3) For Search Function;
	If element is not in list:
		It will simply show that no Stock or MF fits the provided
		criteria.
	Otherwise:
		it will organize the investments into Stocks and MFs and 
		show them to the user.
4) For When user inputs are left blank:
	The program will, based on context, either ignore the parameter,
	like for the search function, or consider it as 0.
5) All values are inputed as a positive value, and the program will use 
   those values to compute the proper calculations and provide final 
   values in either positive or negative values.
6) I tested my code with a file called testfile.txt inside my ePortfolio 
   folder so my command line argument was ePortfolio/testfile.txt. This 
   also works without a file if there is no initial investment list.
